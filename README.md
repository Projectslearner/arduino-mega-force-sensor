# Force Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Force Sensor project utilizes an Arduino Mega to measure and calculate the applied force using an analog force sensor. This project demonstrates how to interface a force sensor with the Arduino Mega, read analog voltage output from the sensor, convert it into applied force using calibration parameters, and display the results on the Serial Monitor. It provides a method to monitor and measure force applications in various projects, from simple load sensing to more complex force measurement tasks.
